    "2.  [**Compute a low-dimensional state representation**](subsec-basis-computation). Approximate the high-dimensional data with only a few degrees of freedom. The simplest approach is to take the SVD of the high-dimensional training data, extract the first few left singular vectors, and use these vectors as a new coordinate basis.\n",
    "3.  [**Set up and solve a low-dimensional regression**](subsec-opinf-regression). Use the low-dimensional representation of the training data to determine a reduced-order model (ROM) that best fits the data in a minimum-residual sense. This is the core objective of the package.\n",
