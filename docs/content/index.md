:::{attention}
This documentation is for `rom_operator_inference` version `2.0.0`, which has not yet been released.
See the current documentation for version `1.2.1` [here](https://github.com/Willcox-Research-Group/rom-operator-inference-Python3/wiki/API-Reference).
:::

This package is a Python implementation of Operator Inference for learning projection-based polynomial reduced-order models of dynamical systems.
The procedure is data-driven and non-intrusive, making it a viable candidate for model reduction of "glass-box" systems where the structure of the governing equations is known but intrusive code queries are unavailable.
