:::

This package is a Python implementation of Operator Inference (OpInf), a projection-based model reduction technique for learning polynomial reduced-order models of dynamical systems.
The procedure is data-driven and non-intrusive, making it a viable candidate for model reduction of "glass-box" systems where the structure of the governing equations is known but intrusive code queries are unavailable.

Get started with [**What is Operator Inference?**](sec-opinf-overview) or head straight to [**Installation**](sec-installation) and the first tutorial, [**Getting Started**](sec-tutorial).
