This package is a Python implementation of Operator Inference for learning projection-based polynomial reduced-order models of dynamical systems.
The procedure is data-driven and non-intrusive, making it a viable candidate for model reduction of "glass-box" systems where the structure of the governing equations is known but intrusive code queries are unavailable.
