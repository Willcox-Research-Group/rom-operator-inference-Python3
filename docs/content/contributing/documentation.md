# Writing Documentation

Our documentation is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and GitHub pages.
Only the maintainers need to worry about GitHub pages, so this guide is about Jupyter Book and our documentation structure.

## Jupyter Books

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) is "an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material."
It allows you write technical content as Markdown files (`.md`) or Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).
Use a notebook if you have code that you actually want to run (examples / tutorials); Markdown is usually sufficient and a little easier otherwise.

## Building Documentation Locally

- `make docs` should do it (`jupyter-book build docs`).
- Documentation is then compiled and stored in `docs/_build`.
- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in Google Chrome to see a preview.

```{important}
Do not `git add` the build files from `docs/_build`!
Only the `gh-pages` branch should track this folder.
The `.gitignore` should remind you of this if you accidentally try to add them.
```

## Documentation Structure

- `docs/_config.yml`
- `docs/_toc.yml`
- `docs/references.bib`
- `docs/requirements.txt`
- `docs/images/`: contains all static images not generated by code in a notebook. SVGs are preferable
- `docs/content/`: Should be somewhat obvious from the structure of the page you're looking at and from `docs/_toc.yml`.
- `docs/content/examples/`

## Helpful Jupyter Book References

Some particularly useful pages from [the Jupyter Book topic guides](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html):

- [Special content boxes (notes, tips, warnings, etc.)](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html)
- [References and cross-references](https://jupyterbook.org/content/references.html)
- [Math and equations](https://jupyterbook.org/content/math.html)
- [Citations and bibliographies](https://jupyterbook.org/content/citations.html)
- [Images and Figures](https://jupyterbook.org/content/figures.html)
