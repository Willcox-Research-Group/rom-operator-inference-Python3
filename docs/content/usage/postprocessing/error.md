# Evaluating ROM Accuracy

Let $\mathbf{q}(t)$ be the true state solution of the system of interest and $\mathbf{q}_\text{ROM}(t)$ the approximation generated by a reduced-order model (see the previous page). This section lists tools for quantifying the error between $\mathbf{q}(t)$ and $\mathbf{q}_\text{ROM}(t)$.
