# Writing Documentation

Our documentation is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and GitHub pages.
Only the maintainers need to worry about GitHub pages, so this guide focuses on Jupyter Book and our documentation structure.

:::{admonition} Summary

- Documentation is stored as Markdown files or Jupyter notebooks in the `docs/` folder.
- Use `tox -e literature,docs` to compile the documentation locally.
- Do **not** `git add` files from `docs/_build/`.

## Jupyter Book

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) is "an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material."
It allows you write technical content as Markdown files (`.md`) or Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).
Use a notebook if you have code that you actually want to run (e.g., in tutorials); Markdown is often sufficient and a little easier otherwise.

## Documentation Structure

All documentation is grouped in the `docs/` folder.
The project `README.md` should be kept short and refer to the official documentation.

- `docs/_config.yml`: configuration for the Jupyter Book format.
- `docs/_toc.yml`: documentation table of contents. You will need to modify this file if you add or delete documentation pages.
- `docs/references.bib`: Bibtex citations. Cite them in the documentation with `` {cite}`referencekey` ``.
- `docs/images/`: contains all static images not generated by code in a notebook. SVGs are preferable, PDFs and PNGs are probably fine.
- `docs/source/`: contains all of the files with the actual written documentation. The file tree structure should be somewhat obvious from the structure of the page you're looking at right now and from `docs/_toc.yml`.
- `docs/source/tutorials/`: contains notebooks with full examples for specific applications.

As you can see on the left of this page, `docs/source/` is organized into the following chapters.

- **Operator Inference**: general exposition about the setting and methodology.
- **Tutorials**: notebooks with full examples for specific applications. These should be written in a narrative style: mathematical details are good, but only when accompanied by nontechnical summaries.
- **API Reference**: public function/class signatures and docstrings. Most of these pages are generated automatically (see [jupyterbook.org/advanced/developers](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/developers.html)), but the index for each submodule is a notebook with demonstration code.
- **Developer Guide**: instructions for developers (such as this page).

## Building Documentation Locally

From the root folder of the repository, execute `tox -e docs` to build the documentation.
This is a shortcut for invoking `jupyter-book` with the right prerequisites.
If any changes are made to the [Literature](../opinf/literature.md) page through modifications to `docs/bib2md.py`, run `tox -e literature` first.

The documentation is processed and copied to in `docs/_build`.
Open the file `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a browser to see a preview (try Google Chrome if the file doesn't render nicely).

```{attention}
Do not `git add` the build files from `docs/_build`!
Only the `gh-pages` branch should track this folder.
The `.gitignore` should remind you of this if you accidentally try to add them.
```

## Sphinx Autodoc

Jupyter Book is essentially [an opinionated wrapper](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) around [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), a program for generating Python documentation.
This project uses [Jupyter Book with Sphinx Autodoc](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/advanced/developers.html) to automatically generate documentation straight from code docstrings.
Because of our settings for the automatic documentation generation, please follow these guidelines.

- Class docstrings should _not_ have a "Methods" section.
- [Properties](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property) show up automatically in the documentation, but attributes created at runtime do not.
- Use `:math:` environments to write actual math.

Note that docstrings must follow Sphinx syntax, not Jupyter notebook syntax.
For example, use `:math:\`i^2 = -1\`` instead of `$i^2 = -1$`.

## Example: Contributing a New Tutorial

:::{admonition} TODO

- Create a notebook and place it in `docs/souce/tutorials/`.
- Add it to the book with `docs/_toc.yml`.
- Always clear notebook outputs before `git add` ing.
- Add data files to the `data` branch:

```shell
git checkout --orphan data
git switch data
git pull upstream data
git add mynewdatafile.npy
git commit -m "add datafile for <the tutorial>"
git push origin data
```

Then open a pull request to the data branch.
